      "approach": "Initialized a new Rust project by creating `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs`. Implemented the `main` function to print 'Hello World'. Added a test case in `src/main.rs` to verify the output of the program when executed. Also added `[workspace]` to `Cargo.toml` to fix the test environment.",
      "learnings": [
        "Successfully set up a basic Rust project and implemented a 'Hello World' program with an integrated test to verify its output. It's important to correctly configure the `Cargo.toml` for the test environment when dealing with potential workspace conflicts, even for single-crate projects."

        "The `git` tool's working directory context might be different from the `file` and `test` tools, leading to confusing `git status` and `git commit` outputs that refer to files outside the specified project root or create nested directories. It required adding `[workspace]` to `Cargo.toml` to resolve a workspace error during testing."
